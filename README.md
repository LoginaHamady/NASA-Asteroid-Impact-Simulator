# NASA-Asteroid-Impact-Simulator
The NASA-Asteroid Impact Simulator is an online application with interactive features that presents the realistic results of asteroid impacts based on real NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) data and USGS datasets. The application renders the impact in both 3D and 2D formats, thus enabling the users to define asteroid parameters (such as diameter, velocity, impact angle, composition), pick the spot to target, and witness the physical effects in an instant. It has movie-like presentations, games (“Defend Earth” mode), and an AI Risk Advisor for tactical reduction analysis.
